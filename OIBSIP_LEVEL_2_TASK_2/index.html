<h2>A brief summary of Subbhash Chandra Bose</h2>
<h3>Early life and political activity</h3>
<p>
    The son of a wealthy and prominent Bengali lawyer, Bose studied at Presidency College, Calcutta (Kolkata), from which he was expelled in 1916 for nationalist activities, and the Scottish Churches College (graduating in 1919). He then was sent by his parents to the University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. In 1920 he passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, after hearing of the nationalist turmoils in India, he resigned his candidacy and hurried back to India. Throughout his career, especially in its early stages, he was supported financially and emotionally by an elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose (1889–1950), a wealthy Calcutta lawyer and Indian National Congress (also known as the Congress Party) politician.

<h4>Activity in exile</h4>
<p>In Nazi Germany Bose came under the tutelage of a newly created Special Bureau for India, guided by Adam von Trott zu Solz. He and other Indians who had gathered in Berlin made regular broadcasts from the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio beginning in January 1942, speaking in English, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, and Pashto.A little more than a year after the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia, Bose left Germany, traveling by German and Japanese submarines and by plane, and arrived in May 1943 in Tokyo. On July 4 he assumed leadership of the Indian Independence Movement in East Asia and proceeded, with Japanese aid and influence, to form a trained army of about 40,000 troops in Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia. On October 21, 1943, Bose proclaimed the establishment of a provisional independent Indian government, and his so-called Indian National Army (Azad Hind Fauj), alongside Japanese troops, advanced to Rangoon (Yangon) and thence overland into India, reaching Indian soil on March 18, 1944, and moving into Kohima and the plains of Imphal. </p>

<h3>Indian National Army (INA)</h3>
<p>
    The birth of the Indian National Army (INA) was initiated by the head of a Japanese Intelligence Unit and Mohan Singh, a former British Indian Army captain. The Indian National Army was formed in December 1941. The Japanese handed over the Indian prisoners of war to Mohan Singh to strengthen INA. A prominent Indian revolutionary leader, and organiser of the Ghadar Mutiny, Rash Behari Bose, founded the Indian Independence League with the support of Indians in Southeast Asian countries.
    By 1942, there were 40,000 men in the Indian National Army. However, INA disbanded in December 1942, out of disagreements between the Japanese General and Mohan Singh. Mohan Singh believed that INA was used for Japanese propaganda. He was taken into custody, and INA troops dispersed.
    On October 21, 1943, Subhash Chandra Bose revived the “Indian National Army” or” Azad Hind Fauj” in Singapore. He formed the Provisional government in Singapore for India and became the Supreme Commander of the Indian National Army. The authority of the organisation was handed over to him by Rash Behari Bose.
